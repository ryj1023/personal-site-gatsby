                  <p>I have been creating enterprise-level software, specializing in web and mobile app development, since 2016. 
                     My focus is creating scalable and sophisticated software solutions for the ever-evolving web development industry. I spent the last two years as a front end developer at <a href='http://beachhousesinparadise.com/'>Beach Houses in Paradise</a>,
                     a vacation rental platform based out of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, specializing in ocean-to-river beach houses. In the past I've worked as a freelance developer, customizing personal websites and mobile applications in React-Native.
                     About halfway through my Computer Science degree I decided fast-track my learning experience and enter the workforce early by joining <a target='_blank' href='https://thinkful.com'>Thinkful</a>, an immersive mentorship-based online Bootcamp focusing on the most 
                     cutting-edge technologies in Web Development. After graduating, I became a mentor myself, teaching students the fundamentals of Web Development while sharpening my own skillset. I have had the pleasure of working with amazing people, and have learned a great deal 
                     about what separates the good developers from the bad ones. Through the years I've developed a philosophy I live by when it comes to writing clean and consise code:

                              <strong>Scalability.</strong> <span>Always layout the foundation of what you are building with potential expansion in mind. Even simple projects tend to evolve quickly and become more complex over time. Making sure to not code yourself into a corner saves a lot of time in the long run.</span>

               <p>The bulk of my experience in web development is focused on JavaScript frameworks, predominantly React and Vue. For design and layout, I work both with raw HTML/CSS as well as with frameworks like Bootstap and Foundation.
                  Although most of my professional experience focuses on the client-side, I have experience in integrating with servers using Node.js (Express) as well as  NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL) database interaction.
                  I have extensive experience with both REST API and GraphQL data-fetching practices. A few other languages and frameworks I've worked with are PHP, C, C++, Java, and Angular.
